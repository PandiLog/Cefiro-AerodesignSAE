# Cefiro-AerodesignSAE
This repository documents the aerodynamic and structural design contributions for the Cefiro team competing in the SAE AeroDesign Standard category. The project focuses on preliminary airfoil analysis, lift and drag estimation, and CAD reconstruction of a previous fuselage model using SolidWorks.

## Project Overview

Cefiro AeroDesign is a university engineering project aimed at designing and optimizing a radio-controlled aircraft for maximum payload performance. This repository contains aerodynamic simulations, structural design studies, and supporting documentation.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **XFLR5** – Airfoil and aerodynamic analysis
- **SolidWorks** – CAD modeling and fuselage reconstruction
- **Excel** – Performance estimation and comparative calculations

## Key Contributions

- Conducted preliminary analysis of multiple airfoils using XFLR5 under especific mission conditions.
- Calculated lift (\(C_L\)) and drag (\(C_D\)) coefficients to estimate aerodynamic efficiency.
- Determined minimum lift conditions required for takeoff based on expected aircraft weight and wing area.
- Reconstructed a previous aircraft fuselage and main wing in SolidWorks for structural testing and load simulations.
- Prepared supporting Excel documents with comparisons of lift/drag ratios and wing loading.
